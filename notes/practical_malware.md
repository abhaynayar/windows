## Practical Malware Analysis
Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig

### Chapter 0 - Malware Analysis Primer

The goals of malware analysis

1. Host-based signatures: indicators used to detect malicious code on victim computers.
2. Network signatures: used to detect malicious code by monitoring network traffic.

Malware analysis techniques

1. Static analysis
2. Dynamic analysis

Types of malware

- Backdoor
- Botnet
- Downloader
- Information-stealing malware
- Launcher
- Rootkit
- Scareware
- Spam-sending malware
- Worm or virus

### Chapter 1 - Basic Static Techniques

Techniques

- Antivirus Scanning: http://www.virustotal.com/
- Hashing: see if the file has already been identified
- Strings: get hints about functionality

Packed and obfuscated malware

- Obfuscated programs are ones whose execution the malware author has attempted to hide.
- Packed programs are a subset of obfuscated programs in which the malicious program is compressed and cannot be analyzed.
- Packed and obfuscated code will often include LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress
- Packed programs are run using wrappers that unpack and run the program.
- When doing a static analysis, only the wrapper portion can be analysed.
- You can detect packers using a software called [PEiD](https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/PEiD).
- Many PEiD plug-ins will run the malware executable without warning!

Portable Executable Format

- File format used by Windows executables, object code, and DLLs.
- It is a data structure that contains the information necessary for the Windows OS loader to manage the wrapped executable code.

Linked Libraries and Functions

- Imports are functions used by one program that are actually stored in a different program.
- Code libraries can be connected to the main executable by linking.
- Code libraries can be linked statically, dynamically (program start) or during runtime.

Types of linking

- Static linking is popular in UNIX and linux but not so much in malware.
- Runtime linking is commonly used in malware (packed or obfuscated) these are not listed in file header.
- Dynamic linking is the most common. PE header stores info about libraries and functions to be called.

PE header

- We can see dynamically linked functions using [Dependency Walker](http://www.dependencywalker.com).
- Executables can also import functions by ordinal instead of a name.

Common DLLs

- Kernel32.dll
- Advapi32.dll
- User32.dll
- Gdi32.dll
- Ntdll.dll
- WSock32.dll and Ws2\_32.dl
- Wininet.dll

Function naming conventions

- NewFunction = OldFunction + "Ex"
- FunctionA = ASCII string as parameter
- FunctionW = Wide character string as parameter

Imported and exported functions

- Look into documentation for the Windows API through the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) library.
- DLLs and EXEs also export functions. They can be found in the PE file (usually DLLs export not EXEs).

Static analysis in practice

Kernel32.dll

- Manipulate processes: OpenProcess, GetCurrentProcess and GetProcessHeap
- Manipulate files: ReadFile, CreateFile, and WriteFile
- Search through directories: FindFirstFile and FindNextFile

User32.dll

- GUI manipulation: RegisterClassEx, SetWindowText, and ShowWindow
- SetWindowsHookEx: for capturing key strokes (used in spyware).
- RegisterHotKey: a key combination that notifies the application.

PE file headers and sections

- .text: instructions that the CPU executes
- .rdata: import and export information, sometimes (i/e)
- .data: global data that can be accessed from anywhere
- .rsrc: resources such as icons, menus, images and strings
- .pdata: present only in 64-bit executables and stores exception-handling information
- .reloc: contains information for relocation of library files

Examining using [PEView](https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/PEView)

- `IMAGE_NT_HEADERS` > `IMAGE_FILE_HEADERS` > Time Date Stamp: the time when this executable was compiled (can be faked / Delphi programs use a compile time of June 19, 1992).
- `IMAGE_NT_HEADERS` > `IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER` > Console programs have the value `IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_WINDOWS_CUI` and run inside a command window. GUI programs have the value `IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_WINDOWS_GUI` and run within the Windows system.
- `IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER`: Virtual size should be equal to size of raw data. In .text if it is more, it may be packed.

We can also view the resources (.rsrc) using [Resource Hacker](http://www.angusj.com/)

## Chapter 2 - Malware Analysis in Virtual Machines

Just read through most of the chapter... here are some steps given at the end:

1. Start with a clean snapshot with no malware running on it.
2. Transfer the malware to the virtual machine.
3. Conduct your analysis on the virtual machine.
4. Take your notes, screenshots, and data from the virtual machine and transfer it to the physical machine.
5. Revert the virtual machine to the clean snapshot.


## Chapter 3 - Basic Dynamic Analysis

```
C:\>rundll32.exe DLLname, Export arguments
```

- Sometimes Windows doesn't know how to run dlls automatically, for that we use the above command.
- Wherein export arguments specifies the function name to be run inside the dll.
- We can use PEview or PE Explorer to see all the exported functions.
- Instead of function names, we can also have ordinals which should be prepending by a `#`.
- You can even turn a DLL into an executable by modifying the PE header and changing its extension

Process monitor

- Monitor certain registry, file system, network, process, and thread activity.
- To stop procmon from capturing events, choose File > Capture Events.
- Clear all currently captured events to remove irrelevant data by choosing Edit > Clear Display.
- Usually you will have a lot of events in procmon, to focus, use Filter > Filter.
- You can also find some common filters as buttons in the toolbar: registry, file-system, network, process.

Process explorer

- You can double-click a process on the left panel and hit verify to check the digital signature.
- In this properties window, you can also go to the strings tab to check the strings in the process.
- Both the procmon and procexp can be launched directly through `live.sysinternals.com`.
- You can analyzing malicious processes by right clicking and launching dependency walker.



### Chapter 8 - Advanced Dynamic Analysis

- When you step over a function that never returns, it is good to use the record and replay using VMware.
- If an application doesn't handle an exception (first chance) it is given to the debugger as second chance.
- Malwares usually cause first chance exceptions unless they are in environments they don't like.
- Single stepping is implemented as an exception in the OS level by setting the trap flag.
